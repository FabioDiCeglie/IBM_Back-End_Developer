| sudo apt               | `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade` are two commands you can use to keep all of your packages up to date in Debian or a Debian-based Linux distribution.                                                       | `sudo apt update`<br>`sudo apt-get update`<br>`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`                     |
