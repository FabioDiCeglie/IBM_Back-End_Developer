## Final Exam: Building a Microservice App for Back-End Development

For my final exam in the IBM Back-End Development Professional Certificate course, I embarked on an exciting project: building a microservice app. This app consisted of two APIs for songs and pictures, written in Flask, and a Django microservice to handle the front-end.

### Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: Used to develop the APIs for songs and pictures.
- **Django**: Utilized for building the front-end and views.
- **MongoDB**: Chosen as the database to store the app's data.
- **Dockerfile**: Employed Docker to containerize the app and ensure easy deployment.
- **OpenShift and Kubernetes**: Leveraged for managing the infrastructure and scaling the microservices efficiently.

### Project Summary:
The goal of the project was to create a robust microservice app capable of handling requests for songs and pictures. Flask was instrumental in developing the APIs, providing endpoints for users to interact with. Meanwhile, Django handled the front-end, presenting a user-friendly interface to access the services.

### Key Features:
- **Two APIs**: Developed separate APIs for songs and pictures to provide distinct functionalities.
- **Flask Microservice**: Created endpoints using Flask to serve requests for songs and pictures.
- **Django Front-End**: Implemented a user interface with Django to interact with the microservices.
- **MongoDB Database**: Utilized MongoDB to store and manage the app's data efficiently.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized the app using Dockerfile to ensure consistency and portability.
- **Infrastructure Management**: Deployed the app on OpenShift and Kubernetes to handle the infrastructure seamlessly.

### Languages & Software:
- **Python**
- **Flask** and **Django**
- **MongoDB**
- **Docker**
- **OpenShift and Kubernetes**
